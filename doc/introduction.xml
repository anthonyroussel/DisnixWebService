	<para>
		Disnix is a toolset which main purpose is to deploy service-oriented systems into networks
		of machines. Disnix is built on top of Nix; a package manager which has some unique
		features to make deployment safe, reliable, and reproducible.
	</para>

	<para>
		Disnix contains an interface which exposes remote deployment operations
		to client tooling. Disnix is designed to support
		multiple connection protocols by implementing a thin protocol wrapper around
		the core Disnix service. For example, an SSH interface is included
		in the main Disnix distribution allowing someone to execute remote
		deployment steps using an SSH connection.

	<para>
		This package contains the <filename>DisnixWebService</filename>
		wrapper and a <command>disnix-soap-client</command> tool that connects
		to the wrapper. These tools can be combined with the basic Disnix toolset
		to allow it to use the SOAP protocol to perform remote deployment operations.
		The main purpose of this package is to show how a custom protocol wrapper can
		be implemented.
