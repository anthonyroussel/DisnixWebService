	<para>
		Disnix is a toolset used to perform distributed deployment tasks
		and is built on top of Nix; a package manager which has some distinct
		features compared to conventional package
		managers to make deployment safe and reliable.
	</para>

	<para>
		Disnix contains an interface which exposes remote deployment operations
		to the client tooling and developers. Disnix is designed to support
		multiple protocols by implementing a thin protocol wrapper around
		the core Disnix service. For example a SSH interface is included
		in the main Disnix distribution.

	<para>
		This package contains the <filename>DisnixWebService</filename> protocol
		wrapper and the <command>disnix-soap-client</command> tool to connect
		to the server. These tools can be combined with the basic Disnix toolset
		to use the SOAP protocol to perform deployment operations. The main
		purpose of this package is to show how a custom protocol wrapper can
		be implemented.
